# Raspberry E ink clock & Spotify alarm
Disclaimer: this is a project that is by far not completed. The documentation was intended mainly for my personal use, but as I didn’t find any other similar projects, I decided to publish it.

## Prerequisites <br />
*	Raspberry Pi (RPI Zero in my case) <br />
*	Network capabilities <br /> <br />
*	E ink display (Waveshare 4.3inch in my case) <br />
*	microSD card to put weather icons on, any size will work <br />

*	Weather icons (originally taken from: https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/free-icon-set-weather/) <br />
*	Free Open Weather Maps Account <br />
*	All python libraries specified in the main file (note that epd library has to be configured separately) <br />
*	Mopidy and Mopidy Alarm Clock plugin configured and working, make sure your Spotify account and audio work <br />

## How does it work <br />
The whole thing is divided into two parts: the day version and night version. The “Day” version displays clock, current date, day of week and weather information. The “night” version displays information about Spotify alarm. <br />
<br />
*	Stuff is displayed on E ink display via epd library. I use an E ink display from Waveshare. <br />
  *	The display is updated once per minute, this is ensured by a cron job, after it gets updated, it’s put to sleep and waken again during the next update <br /> 
  *	The display is cleared when the current time (minute specifically) divided by 5 is 0, i.e. every 5th minute. <br />
*	Weather information – are fetched via pyowm library from Open Weather Map, thus it’s necessary to create an OWM account.  <br />
*	Spotify is provided by Mopidy, alarm clock capabilities by Mopidy Alarm Clock plugin. <br />
*	The tricky part was how to know if there’s an alarm set up. I just fetch the webpage (e.g. http://192.168.2.110:6690/alarmclock/) and check if content is more than 3000 bytes. I’m able to tell if there’s an alarm set up or not as the page size differs significantly. Nothing to be proud about, but if it looks stupid and it works, it ain’t stupid, right? :-D <br />
*	If there’s an alarm set up, I parse the downloaded webpage and find strings for the time and playlist, which then get displayed. <br />

## How to make it work <br />
After fulfilling the prerequisites, there’re basically just few things that need to be modified in the python script. <br />
*	In getAlarmTme() function modify the url with your own <br />
*	In displayWeather() function insert your own API key you got from OWM and change name of the city to fetch weather info for. <br />
*	Change the number of GPIO pin to the one where you connected the wake-up wire from your display. Comment out these parts and the epd_clear() part in case you don’t want this. <br />
*	It order to get the icons work, copy them on FAT 32 formatted memory card, insert into the display and uncomment the epd_set_memory_sd(), epd_import_pic() and edp_set_memory_nand() parts, wait for a minute or run the script manually. After that the icons should work and you can remove these parts. <br />

I’ve attached icons that I already processed myself, they’re cropped, converted and are verified to be working. <br />

## Known, expected issues and to-dos <br />
*	The number one on my to-do list is to bypass the fact that when RPI is rebooted, the alarm gets erased. <br />
*	I’m sure that there’re some issues with getting the playlist name correctly displayed, especially when foreign accents are used. I implemented a function to remove the ones used in Czech language as I didn’t want to waste time trying to import any fonts to the E ink display. <br />
*	I would like to add a button capability to stop the alarm when the button is pressed. <br />
